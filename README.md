# ultimate-tic-tac-toe
The standard Tic-Tac-Toe game but made more fun! Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is made up of nine standard Tic-Tac-Toe boards where you have to win three individual boards horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win the larger board (and to win the game!). More game rules can be found here: https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/ultimate-tic-tac-toe-original-post/.
